All content is written to Git repo.\r\n  - Create UI for forking posts, revision visualization, suggesting edits, and listing contributors.\r\n  - [Gatsby Gutenberg](https://gatsbywpgutenberg.netlify.app/)\r\n\r\n### No Code Static Site Builder\r\n\r\n## Businessing Notes\r\n\r\n### Who Uses This\r\n\r\n- Plugin\r\n  - Developers\r\n    - Building websites.\r\n- Worker\r\n  - Developers\r\n  - Enterprise\r\n  - Part of a product.\r\n- Site Builder\r\n  - SMB\r\n  - Startups\r\n  - Enterprise\r\n","slug":"wp-headless-mode","references":[{"slug":"wordpress","url":"/notes/wordpress"},{"slug":"next","url":"/notes/next"},{"slug":"gatsby","url":"/notes/gatsby"}]},"slug":"wp-headless-mode"},"__N_SSG":true}

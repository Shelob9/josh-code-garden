{"pageProps":{"note":{"title":"Standing Desk","content":"Standing desks are great. I am a big fan of standing about 2/3s of the time at my computer. It forces me to take more regular breaks. It's harder to ignore my body when I'm standing.\r\n\r\n## Rising Desk\r\n\r\nI can't stand all day and I have a desk, so I got this from fully:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.fully.com/standing-desks/desk-converters/cooper-standing-desk-converter.html\r\n\r\nI got the larger model beacuse I have two monitors, a mic and a bunch of stones on my desk. The smaller one is probably better if you just have a laptop.\r\n\r\n## Standing Mat\r\n\r\nYou can't stand at a desk all day barefoot. Wearing shoes to work defeats the whole purpose. So I got this from fully:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.fully.com/accessories/standing-desk-mats/muvmat-by-aeris.html\r\n\r\nThis mat is so amazing. I love it. It forces me to move around -- standing still all day is very unhealthy/ painful. The texture massages my feet and it provides a fidget-like experience that is helpful for ADD.\r\n\r\nIf you wear shoes at work, you probably should get a rubber mat. A move mat also would be pretty cool.\r\n","slug":"standing-desk","references":[]},"slug":"standing-desk"},"__N_SSG":true}

{"pageProps":{"note":{"title":"Code Meadow","content":"This is [Josh](https://joshpress.net)'s collection of in progress tutorials, useful snippets and other useful stuff related to [[php : PHP]] and [[javascript: JavaScript ]] development.\n\nThis is site is built using [Digital Garden Builder](https://digitalgardenbuilder.app/). [I also have a digital garden, not related to writing code.](https://code.joshpress.net)\n\nRight now, it helps test my theory that hosting these sites with [[gh-pages]] is a good idea.\n\n## What Is Growing\n\nHere are some of the notes I am working on now:\n\n- [[gh-actions]]\n- [[gh-pages]]\n- [[laravel-eloquent]]\n- [[tailwind-react-typescript]]\n\n## What I Am Working On Now\n\nMy fun side project is [[digital-garden-builder]], which is what this site is built with. [Digital Garden Builder](http://docs.digitalgardenbuilder.app/) uses the [[gitcms]] that I am working on for data storage. My goal is to build distributed peer 2 peer knowledge grpah apps.\n\n### WordPress Plugin Template\n\nI maintain an opinionated [WordPress plugin starter template](https://shelob9.github.io/wordpress-plugin). It has local development, testing, Github actions and Composer-based dependency managemnet and autoloader setup. \n\nIt also has a basic mode that has less stuff, just compiling React in a WordPress-safe way and a PHP file you can write PHP in.\n","slug":"code-meadow","references":[{"slug":"gh-pages","url":"/notes/gh-pages"},{"slug":"gh-actions","url":"/notes/gh-actions"},{"slug":"gh-pages","url":"/notes/gh-pages"},{"slug":"laravel-eloquent","url":"/notes/laravel-eloquent"},{"slug":"tailwind-react-typescript","url":"/notes/tailwind-react-typescript"},{"slug":"digital-garden-builder","url":"/notes/digital-garden-builder"},{"slug":"gitcms","url":"/notes/gitcms"}]},"slug":"code-meadow"},"__N_SSG":true}

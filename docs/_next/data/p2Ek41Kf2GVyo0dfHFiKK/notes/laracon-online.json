In this article, I will share tips and tricks learned from designing for various cultures, and how to apply culture differences in user experience design.\r\n\r\n1. Address cultural characteristics\r\n\r\nThrough projects of designing for different cultures, I learned to address cultural characteristics in my designs. Even though we are familiar with design patterns, it may surprise us when users of a different culture react to them in a way we didn’t expect.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Scaling Laravel Jack Ellis\r\n\r\n- [[laravel-vapor]]\r\n\r\nFirst step for scaling Fathom was to move processing of data -- caluculating aggregates -- to queues. In v1 recorded page views to a table, and used queues to process data to aggregates.\r\n\r\nIn v2, page view controller, dispatches a job after response to record page view. Uses retry() around the job dispatch to ensure it gets recorded. Use cache to scale a fixed Vapor db.\r\n\r\nSome customers getting super high traffic could prevent less popular pages form gettign agregatation jobs run. Put sites into groups, group ID column is index. Runs all groups on a loop.\r\n\r\n- Always assume queue and database will fail: use `retry()`\r\n- Cache everything you can.\r\n- Watch I/Os on database\r\n- Currently moving from MySQL to ElasticSearch and DynamoDB\r\n\r\n- https://usefathom.com/blog/viral\r\n- https://usefathom.com/blog/tech-stack\r\n- https://usefathom.com/blog/vapor-one-year\r\n","slug":"laracon-online","references":[{"slug":"laravel","url":"/notes/laravel"},{"slug":"laravel-vapor","url":"/notes/laravel-vapor"}]},"slug":"laracon-online"},"__N_SSG":true}

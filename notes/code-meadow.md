   This is [Josh](https://joshpress.net)'s collection of in progress tutorials, useful snippets and other useful stuff related to [[php : PHP]] and [[javascript: JavaScript ]] development.

This is site is built using [Digital Garden Builder](https://digitalgardenbuilder.app/). [I also have a digital garden, not related to writing code.](https://code.joshpress.net)

Right now, it functions to test my theory that hosting these sites with [[gh-pages]] is a good idea.

## What Is Growing

Here are some of the notes I am working on now:

- [[gh-actions]]
- [[gh-pages]]
- [[laravel-eloquent]]
- [[tailwind-react-typescript]]

## What I Am Working On Now

At work, my main focus is building internal apps -- user telemetry and customer support applications. This helps us understand our users and the [[wordPress]]ecosytem better. I get to build most of that with [[Laravel]] and [[React]], which is super fun.

My fun side project is [[digital-garden-builder]], which is built with [[nextjs]] and a part of [[meadow]].

### Saturday Drive

At Saturday Drive, I do [[WordPress]], [[Laravel]] and [[React]] development:
